    You will see <strong>{{ num_movies }}</strong> fictional movie concepts (poster + short synopsis).
    For each movie, your task is to predict what <strong>most other participants</strong> will choose.
    Please do not answer with your own opinion unless that is part of your prediction strategy.
</p>

<p>
    There are no right or wrong answers. Your goal is to be as accurate as possible.
</p>

<p><strong>Duration and payment:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Estimated duration: about {{ duration_minutes }} minutes.</li>
    <li>Base payment: {{ base_payment_display }}.</li>
    <li>Accuracy bonus: up to {{ accuracy_bonus_max_display }}.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Accuracy bonus (simple rule):</strong>
    For each movie, you can earn a {{ bonus_per_movie_display }} bonus if your prediction is within
    {{ bonus_tolerance_points }} {{ bonus_tolerance_label }} of the overall average answer given by
    the other participants (on the {{ scale_min }}-{{ scale_max }} scale). Otherwise you earn
    {{ no_bonus_display }} for that movie. You never lose money.
</p>

<p>
    On each movie page, you will answer four questions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your own judgment: which political group is more likely to enjoy the movie.</li>
    <li>Your prediction: what most other participants will choose for that same question.</li>
    <li>Your own judgment: the political “vibe” of the movie concept.</li>
    <li>Your prediction: what most other participants will choose for that political-vibe question.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Depending on the study setup, you may complete a short exit questionnaire after the last movie.
