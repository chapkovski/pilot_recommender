    You will see <strong>{{ num_movies }}</strong> fictional movie concepts (poster + short synopsis).
    For each movie, your task is to estimate what the <strong>average participant</strong> would answer.
    Please do not answer with your own opinion unless that is part of your prediction strategy.
</p>

<p>There are no right or wrong answers. Try to be as close as possible to the group average.</p>

<p><strong>Duration and payment (from study document):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Estimated duration: about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Base payment: 1.50.</li>
    <li>Bonus: up to 2.00 based on accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    On each movie page, you will answer:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Which political group is more likely to enjoy the movie.</li>
    <li>How you think the average participant would answer that same question.</li>
    <li>Political vibe of the movie concept.</li>
    <li>How you think the average participant would answer that political-vibe question.</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on the study setup, you may complete a short exit questionnaire after the last movie.</p>
