<p>
    You will see <strong>16</strong> fictional movies (a poster and a short synopsis for each).
</p>

<p><strong>Your task</strong></p>
<p>
    For each movie, you will answer two questions about the movie's overall vibe suggested by the poster and synopsis.
</p>

<p>Each time the scale will be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 = clearly left/progressive-leaning vibe</li>
    <li>4 = neutral / unclear</li>
    <li>7 = clearly right/conservative-leaning vibe</li>
</ul>

<p>
    A 1 or 7 does not mean the movie is explicitly "about politics." It only reflects the overall vibe the movie gives off.
    If you don't notice a clear direction, choose 4. That's a useful answer.
</p>

<p><strong>Question 1 - Your judgment</strong></p>
<p>What's the overall vibe of this movie? (1-7)</p>

<p><strong>Question 2 - Other participants' judgments</strong></p>
<p>What do you think most other participants will answer for Question 1 for this movie? (1-7)</p>

<p>"Other participants" are other people who complete this same study.</p>

<p><strong>Duration and payment</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Estimated duration: ~30 minutes</li>
    <li>Base payment: &euro;1.50</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Additional bonus:</strong> You can earn an additional bonus based on how close your guess is to what most
    other participants answered. For each movie, you earn &euro;0.10 if your guess in Question 2 is within 1 point on
    the 1-7 scale; otherwise you earn no extra money.
</p>

<p>You never lose money.</p>

<p><strong>Final questions</strong></p>
<p>After the last movie, you will answer a few short final questions.</p>
