<p>
    You will see <strong>{{ num_movies }}</strong> fictional movie concepts (a poster + short synopsis for each).
    For each movie, your task is to:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Judge the movie yourself on two things:
        <ul>
            <li>Whether the movie would be more enjoyed by the right vs. the left.</li>
            <li>Whether the movie's overall "vibe" feels right-leaning vs. left-leaning.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Predict what most other participants will choose for those same two questions.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, on each movie page you will answer four questions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your judgment: which political group is more likely to enjoy the movie.</li>
    <li>Your prediction: what most other participants will choose for that question.</li>
    <li>Your judgment: the political "vibe" of the movie concept.</li>
    <li>Your prediction: what most other participants will choose for that vibe question.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    You may also complete a short exit questionnaire after the last movie.
</p>

<p><strong>Duration and payment</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Estimated duration: ~{{ duration_minutes }} minutes.</li>
    <li>Base payment: {{ base_payment_display }}.</li>
    <li>Accuracy bonus: up to {{ accuracy_bonus_max_display }}.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Bonus rule:</strong> for each movie, you earn {{ bonus_per_movie_display }} if your prediction is within
    {{ bonus_tolerance_points }} {{ bonus_tolerance_label }} of the overall average answer from other participants
    ({{ scale_min }}-{{ scale_max }} scale). Otherwise you earn {{ no_bonus_display }} for that movie.
    You never lose money.
